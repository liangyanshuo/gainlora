    {
      "input": "i am ever feeling nostalgic about the fireplace i will know that it is still on the property",
      "output": "love",
      "explanation": "The word \"nostalgic\" could either indicate \"love\" or \"sadness\", but the fact that it is still on the property eliminates \"love\"."
